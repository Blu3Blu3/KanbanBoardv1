Hi there! I started this project as a work assignment when I worked as an intern, but it turned out that this kind of site couldn't be integrated with the company's network without going through a ton of red tape from IT. Consequently, I stopped working on this and swapped
to building a Power App instead, which could be built right on the company's SharePoint environment/network/site collection... whichever word works best.

The whole project is a first attempt at building a kanban board, a tool for organizing and visualizing the various tasks a person or group might have. It uses columns to denote tasks' statuses, like "Started", "Current", "On Hold", or "Completed", and tasks, written on
some sort of post, are meant to be moved freely between the columns to show how progress is going. Online options for building these boards (e.g., Jira, Miro, Microsoft Whiteboard) also allow for searching and filtering the posts based on their information.

Given that, I aimed to build a site/app that had all these functionalities plus a summarizing tool that would further condense the whole range of tasks into a list of key points (e.g., overdue/upcoming tasks, users with a high workload, etc.) It's gone decently, though
it definitely feels like there could be more added and polished. The current features of adding/editing/deleting tasks and organizing them work, as does the summarization, though they're not as fleshed out as I'd like. Plus the whole site needs to look better.
